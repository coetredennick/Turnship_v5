You're absolutely right. Let's cut the BS and ship. Here's a lean roadmap to production:

## **WEEK 1: Core Flow (Auth → Send Email)**

### Day 1-2: Auth
- Wire up Google OAuth (you have the creds already)
- Simple session check on protected routes
- Login/logout buttons in the UI
- Store user in session, done

### Day 3-4: Gmail Integration  
- Get Gmail OAuth consent working
- Store tokens in database (encrypted)
- One function: `sendEmail(to, subject, body)`
- Test sending real emails

### Day 5-7: Connect Everything
- User signs in → sees dashboard
- Add connection form (just name/email/company)
- Compose page: pick contact → write email → send
- Email sends through Gmail API
- Mark connection as "contacted"

**End of Week 1: You can sign in, add contacts, and send emails**

---

## **WEEK 2: Make It Useful**

### Day 8-9: OpenAI Email Generation
- Simple prompt: "Write email to {name} at {company} about {purpose}"
- One endpoint: `POST /api/generate-email`
- Wire to the Compose UI
- Keep the prompt simple, iterate later

### Day 10-11: Bulk Features
- CSV upload for connections (basic parsing)
- Select multiple contacts → generate personalized emails
- Send to multiple (with 1-second delay between sends)

### Day 12-14: Follow-ups & Timeline
- After sending email, create timeline event
- Set follow-up for 7 days later
- Simple follow-up page showing what's due
- Mark follow-ups as done

**End of Week 2: Full flow works with AI and bulk operations**

---

## **PRODUCTION CHECKLIST (2-3 days)**

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production must-haves only
DATABASE_URL (Supabase/Neon/Railway)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  
OPENAI_API_KEY
SESSION_SECRET
CLIENT_URL
```

### Deploy
- Backend: Railway or Render (one click from GitHub)
- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify (auto-deploys)
- Database: Supabase (already have the SQL)

### Critical Fixes Before Launch
1. Error handling on all API routes (try/catch)
2. Loading states on buttons (prevent double-clicks)
3. Rate limit Gmail sends (1 per second max)
4. Add Sentry for error tracking
5. Test the FULL flow on production

## **What We're NOT Doing**
- ❌ No Redis/caching
- ❌ No job queues  
- ❌ No complex analytics
- ❌ No WebSockets
- ❌ No payment integration
- ❌ No fancy animations
- ❌ No mobile app
- ❌ No email templates (just text)

## **What We ARE Doing**
- ✅ Google sign in
- ✅ Add/import contacts
- ✅ Generate emails with AI
- ✅ Send through Gmail
- ✅ Track what was sent
- ✅ Simple follow-up reminders
- ✅ Ship to production

---

## **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Get it running locally RIGHT NOW
cd server
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev

# Another terminal
cd client  
npm install
npm run dev

# You're up
```

## **Success Metrics**
- User can sign in with Google ✓
- Upload 20 contacts via CSV ✓  
- Generate 20 personalized emails ✓
- Send them all ✓
- See follow-ups due next week ✓

**That's it. Everything else is feature creep.**

## **Daily Standup Questions**
1. Can a user sign in and send an email yet?
2. What's blocking that?
3. Are we adding anything not on this list?

Ship in 2 weeks. Get users. Iterate based on feedback. Don't overthink it.

Want me to start implementing any specific piece right now? I'd suggest starting with the Google OAuth since you already have the setup.
